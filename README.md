           This project highlights the need for effective resources to enhance the BMO InvestorLine platform by improving existing application features. The competitive analysis outlines weaknesses in dependency on the North American economy and market standing along with operational risks and competitiveness challenges faced by BMO. Opportunities such as addressing inflation risks and supply chain disruptions are identified alongside threats like operational risks and competitiveness issues.

           Furthermore, the Project details the problem to be solved which revolves around the underperformance of the BMO InvestorLine investing platform despite being part of the esteemed Bank of Montreal. It discusses competitive lag issues compared to other Canadian online brokers and market dynamics challenges due to economic fluctuations. The report suggests enhancing the platform's appeal through feature enhancements aligned with diverse investor needs, informative security requirements for data privacy protection compliance with industry standards encryption protocols. Performance requirements include multi-platform support for seamless user experience and UI/UX design considerations for intuitive interfaces.

           The potential solutions provided in the report for enhancing the BMO InvestorLine trading platform include internal development, hybrid development, and maintaining the status quo.

    Internal Development: This solution involves enhancing the platform through internal development efforts. It focuses on improving existing features, user interface, and accessibility to cater to a larger customer base.
   
    Hybrid Development:  The hybrid development approach combines internal development with external resources or technologies. This strategy aims to utilize both in-house expertise and external capabilities effectively to enhance the platform.
    Status Quo: Maintaining the status quo may offer stability and consistency in the short term. It could potentially save time and resources that would otherwise be spent on implementing changes. Additionally, if the current platform is functioning adequately and meeting user needs, there may be minimal disruption to users or business operations by staying with the familiar system.

    To conclude, we suggested going with Internal or Hybrid development because if BMO wants to stay in the race to become the best online trading platform provider, it must adapt to the latest technological needs.
